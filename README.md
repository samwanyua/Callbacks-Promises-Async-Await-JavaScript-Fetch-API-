## Introduction

Understanding asynchronous programming is crucial in modern JavaScript development. This tutorial aims to provide a clear and practical guide to Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await. It specifically focuses on their application in conjunction with the JavaScript Fetch API.

## Callbacks

Callbacks are a traditional way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are functions passed as arguments to another function and executed after the completion of the asynchronous task.

## Promises

Promises are a more structured approach to handle asynchronous tasks. They represent a value which might be available now, or in the future, or never.

## Async/Await

Async/Await is a syntax sugar built on top of Promises. It allows writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.

## JavaScript Fetch API

The Fetch API provides a modern, Promise-based interface to make network requests. It is commonly used for fetching resources from a server.

## Thenables

Thenables are objects with a `then` method. Promises are a type of thenable, and async/await works with thenables as well.

## Examples

Explore the provided examples to understand how Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await can be applied to real-world scenarios using the Fetch API.
